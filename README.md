### What I learned

- I had a little scare applying my box-shadows, but weathered through it with style. ðŸ˜Š
- I also used this challenge as a means to improve my usage of the CSS Grid Layout module and FlexBox module.
- I am delighted that this is a good challenge to practise my CSS custom settings and variables.

### Continued development

I still would love to improve on my Grid Layout skills, working on more complicated layout designs I can find and remake.
